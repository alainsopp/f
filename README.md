## A locally runnable personal budget tracking and financial web application

This application is aimed at two types of profiles.  

First, individuals who are looking for a tool to track their incomes and expenses.  
The application allows to break expenses into categories and periods that can be  
visualized via synthetic and comprehensive charts.  
In addition, multiple key metrics like accounts balances at the end of month, are  
available to help understand the money flow, spot inconsistencies and improve capital  
management.  

The second profile, is investors that desire to have a global view of the assets they own.  
With this application, investors can :
- Group their assets by classes and visualize their portfolio repartition
- Track their portfolio performance via several metrics, like MRR over weeks, months or even years.

Finally, both profiles have access to transversal features like patrimony overview and evolution over a specific period.
